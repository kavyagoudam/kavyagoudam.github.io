Steps to create a portfolio for free

1. Search on Google for portfolio templates.

There are many websites that offer free portfolio templates for different professions and industries. You can use Google to find a template that suits your needs. For example, if you're a software developer, you can search for "software developer portfolio free download" on Google. You can also try different variations of the search term to find more options. Once you find a template you like, download it to your computer.

2. Launch the "index.html" page and modify the content.

After you have downloaded the portfolio template, open the folder containing the files and locate the "index.html" file. This file serves as the landing page for your portfolio website. Double-click on the file to open it in your web browser. You should see the template layout with filler text and images.

Now you can modify the content to showcase your own skills, experience, and projects. Use a text editor to edit the HTML and CSS files to make changes to the layout, fonts, colors, and other design elements. Add your own text, images, and videos to showcase your work. You can also add links to your social media profiles and online portfolio pages. Once you have made all the necessary changes, save the files and move on to the next step.

3. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/. If you already have a GitHub account, log in to it.

4. Create a new repository by clicking the "+" sign in the top-right corner of your GitHub dashboard and selecting "New repository".

9. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select "Master branch" as your source.
